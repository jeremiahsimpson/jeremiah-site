Meet Hickory Mertsching [h3]

Hickory Mertsching is a brilliant local painter that just dropped off two new pieces at the shop. His work will be a fixture in our space because his sensibility is in total alignment with the Beam & Anchor aesthetic. His still lifes include birds, skulls, tools, plants and industrial detritus. All of these elements are in part inspired by the landscape in Wisconsin where he grew up and the Northwestern landscape that he now calls home. [p]

We had our Friends & Family opening party on Friday April 20th and it was the first time that we had invited our tribe into the B&A space to see what we had created. We were both nervous and excited to finally present ourselves to our community. The response was overwhelming and we were totally humbled by the love and support we received. [p]
